# Understanding Heap, Stack, and Memory Leaks in C++

This README explains the concepts of Heap, Stack, and Memory Leaks using a simple C++ program that creates and deletes a `Fruit` object. 

## Code Overview

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

struct Fruit {
    string name;
    int age;
};

Fruit* createFruit(string name, int age);

int main() {
    Fruit* someFruit = createFruit("Anana", 5);
    cout << "Crazy pointer: " << &someFruit << endl;

    cout << "Fruit's name is: " << someFruit->name << endl;
    cout << "Reference: " << &someFruit << endl;

    // Delete memory in Heap
    delete someFruit;
    someFruit = nullptr; // Set pointer to nullptr after deletion
    cout << "Heap (data after delete): " << someFruit << endl;
    cout << "Heap (pointer after delete): " << &someFruit << endl;

    return 0;
}

Fruit* createFruit(string name, int age) {
    // Heap
    Fruit* fruit = new Fruit;
    fruit->name = name;
    fruit->age = age;
    cout << &fruit << endl;

    return fruit;
}
```

## Key Concepts

### 1. Stack
The Stack is a region of memory that stores function parameters, local variables, and control data. Stack memory is automatically managed; it is allocated and deallocated as functions are called and returned. 

In the code:
- The variables `someFruit` in `main` and `fruit` in `createFruit` are stored on the Stack. However, these are pointers that point to the actual data stored in the Heap.

### 2. Heap
The Heap is a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation. Memory in the Heap must be managed manually; it is allocated using `new` and deallocated using `delete`.

In the code:
- The `createFruit` function allocates memory for a `Fruit` object on the Heap using `new`.
- The `someFruit` pointer in `main` holds the address of this memory.
- After using the `Fruit` object, the program calls `delete someFruit` to free the memory on the Heap.

### 3. Memory Leak (Water Leak)
A Memory Leak occurs when dynamically allocated memory on the Heap is not properly deallocated, resulting in memory being "lost" to the program. This can lead to increased memory usage and potentially exhaust available memory.

In the code:
- If the program fails to call `delete someFruit`, the memory allocated for the `Fruit` object on the Heap would not be freed, causing a memory leak.
- Setting `someFruit` to `nullptr` after deletion helps avoid accidental use of the pointer, preventing undefined behavior.

### Output Explanation

The program output might look like this:
```
0x7fff9dbb1ab0
Crazy pointer: 0x7fff9dbb1ab0
Fruit's name is: Anana
Reference: 0x7fff9dbb1ab0
Heap (data after delete): 0
Heap (pointer after delete): 0x7fff9dbb1ab0
```

- The address `0x7fff9dbb1ab0` represents the location of the pointer variable on the Stack, not the memory it points to on the Heap.
- After calling `delete`, `someFruit` is set to `nullptr`, so `someFruit` prints as `0` (null).
- The address of the pointer itself remains the same because `delete` only frees the memory the pointer points to, not the pointer's own location on the Stack.

## Conclusion
This simple program demonstrates the importance of properly managing dynamic memory in C++. Understanding the distinction between Stack and Heap memory, and being vigilant about avoiding memory leaks, is crucial for writing efficient and reliable C++ programs.
